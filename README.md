My playground project for jee6 stuff.

Kickstart with maven and jetty / jersey by typing the following in your console:

    > mvn compile
    > mvn jetty:run-exploded

Test the rest servlet in your console:

    curl http://localhost:8080/jee6-playground/rest/basic/helloWorld
    curl http://localhost:8080/jee6-playground/rest/basic/hello/Jim
    curl http://localhost:8080/jee6-playground/rest/basic/person/7
